Migrating to Agnostic Markdown Pages:
  ☐ No way for plugin to add pages without creating dynamic pages and would reduce efficiency (all sasdoc data included)
  ☐ Instead this package should just be agnostic and output standard markdown
    ☐ How to do the things like dynamic render (previews)?
      ☐ Could we just output examples directory with pages that can be viewed in markdown (iframe)?
    ☐ As a separate package make vitepress specific if needed
